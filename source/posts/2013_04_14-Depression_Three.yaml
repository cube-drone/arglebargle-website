  Every morning. "Good morning. You're going to die. Would you like to think about
  the ramifications of that?" Shut up, brain.  

  I feel like I live without meaning or hope in a universe that I can't possibly 
  understand, like if a soap bubble had unfortunately become sentient. 
  
  All of this "it doesn't matter, you're going to die anyways" playing endlessly on
  repeat has thrown a wrench
  in my goal-oriented brain-processing. Standard operating procedure is 
  "make a plan, follow through, feel good", or "make a plan, watch it fall apart,
  feel bad, try again". The way it works now, though, is "make a plan, follow through,
  you're going to die anyways, feel bad". This makes planning extremely difficult.
  
  The reward structures in my brain just aren't kicking out any juice. Did my taxes, 
  $1500 refund! Nope. Money won't make you happy. Delicious sandwich! Food won't work. 
  Fixed a problem with some code! Problem solving won't cut it. Wrote something!
  No, creativity won't make you feel good, either. 
  
  All paths lead to the same conclusion, so no path is superior to any other. 
  
  In fact, the only plan that Planning comes up with, anymore, is "lie on couch,
  give in to despair, television optional".  Also, I suppose I decided to keep 
  on writing about it, if anything just to share this unique and wonderful 
  experience with others.
  
  So, no short-term or long-term planning really occurring in here. What does that 
  leave? 
  
  Well, "Crisis Control" is on the scene, automating the basics. I don't want to
  lose my job or starve to death or even 'be cold', so Crisis Control keeps me
  organized enough for short bursts of activity. Meetings, simple bugs, driving
  from one place to another, eating, sleeping. Crisis Control can't be counted
  on to keep the lights on, long-term, though - it doesn't provide any vision or 
  drive, really. 
  
  As a positive note, Crisis Control makes much more bare-bones decisions about
  eating than standard happiness-driven Curtis. I've lost 13 lbs, so far, and counting. 
  
  Then there's distraction - talking to people or watching television. Distraction
  removes me from the problem entirely (which is nice) but doesn't solve anything.

  This week I've enjoyed golf, writing, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and 
  Parks and Recreation, and I'm filing all of those under "Distraction". 

  So right now, all I feel like is.. nothing.
