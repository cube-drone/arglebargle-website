  <classam> if I'm in vim and go 
  <classam> :! complicated shell command 
  <classam> ... and I want to run that complicated shell command _again_ without having to retype it, is there a keystroke for that?
  <yangman> : <up arrow>
  <classam> oh, hey, nice
  <yangman> it's actually context sensitive, to a degree
  <classam> I have to scroll through all of my compulsive :w's, though >_> :P
  <yangman> if you go :! then up-arrow, it'll only show those
  <classam> Nice
