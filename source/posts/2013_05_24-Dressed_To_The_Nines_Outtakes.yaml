  <zzSleeper> rhetzler_work, plyp_home, plypkie, yangman, vlad|job: mumble is back up, sorry for the interruption
  <rhetzler_work> ohai
  <rhetzler_work> are you back?
  <plypkie> zzSleeper: jeez, I'm paying for 5 9s service here. I demand to be compensated for downtime.
  <classam> alternatively, "mmb mrrm blrbl flrp"
  <yangman> heh
  <plypkie> zzSleeper: but actually we've just been using yangman's server
  <zzSleeper> bank changed my address while I was gone, resulted in payment failure :P
  <zzSleeper> yangman also has a server?
  <yangman> yeah, I set up a mumble server ages ago
  <yangman> vlad and I used for SC2 for a bit
  <yangman> it's running off of my home connection
  <classam> plypkie: You're getting 5 9 service. That's about how tall zzSleeper is, if I remember correctly >_>
  <classam> shit, there might be a cube drone in that
  <classam> Phone: "Our server is down."  Warbeard: "I know it's down." / Phone: "It can't be down, you promised us five nines support." / Warbeard: "No, we promised you 5'9" uptime. I'm your support guy, and I'm about 5'9", so you're good. "
  <classam> unh
  <classam> I immediately do not like that comic anymore
  <classam> Am I spelling it out too much maybe?
  <classam> Maybe there's a joke in offering 50.0099999% uptime (five nines!)
  <rhetzler_work> "our support guys are playing ping pong, they're been stuck in the same rally for over an hour." "what about my 5 9's support?" "well yeah.. you see, that's the score…" "what?" "5 - 9"
  <classam> Or a joke in offering 99.999% support. ("Oh, yeah, the server goes down pretty often. But our support guys are available 99.999% of the time")
  <rhetzler_work> "if they both get 2 more points, they hit the sev."
  <classam> Maybe "Our server is down"  "Yeah, scheduled maintenance." / "But you promised us five nines uptime."  "Read your contract" / last panel : * 50.099999% uptime
  <classam> Still kinda mediocre joke, though
  <classam> eh, they can't all be clever
