  <belam> Any of the vancouverites are hiring? I know someone how's looking to go from Victoria -> Vancouver. Game / Film is preferred, but what the heck.
  <n0ob> hiring for what?
  <n0ob> my company is hiring for top software developers
  <belam> dev
  <belam> n0ob: I do have a feeling she might not prefer kernel devs
  <belam> n0ob: but shoot anyways
  <n0ob> we have things other than kernel dev
  <belam> n0ob: got a link?
  <n0ob> aristanetworks.com
  <n0ob> is she capable of linux dev?
  <belam> dunno
  * n0ob wonders how employee bonus works for friends of a friend of a friend
  <belam> I have a feeling that might depend on how badly she wants to leave Victoria :p
  <belam> anyways, I'll let her figure that out
  <n0ob> I ask because there is a screening test which kinda requires it
  <belam> ah I see
  <n0ob> so if she doesn't know c and linux dev then it's likely not worth her time since she won't get past the screening
  <classam> "The New Standard in Software Defined Cloud Networks" wow what an awful tagline
  <n0ob> don't ask me, I'm not in marketing
  <classam> SO AN ARISTA NETWORKS ENGINEER GOES TO A JOB INTERVIEW.  "LET ME SHOW YOU A JOKE", HE SAYS, THEN HE STUFFS A FULL 100 FOOT ROLL OF NETWORK CABLE INTO HIS ASS. 
  <plypkie> they put their marketing in the cloud
  <classam> "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?" SAYS THE INTERVIEWEE. 
  <classam> ... "THE ARISTA CAT-5" 
  <plypkie> ...
  <n0ob> that's pretty funny
  <n0ob> makes me wish I had watched The Aristocrats
  <vlad|job> ... wow
  <vlad|job> that's... pretty good
