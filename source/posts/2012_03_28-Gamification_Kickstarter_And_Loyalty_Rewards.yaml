  <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books/about/Gamification_by_Design.html?id=zZcpuMRpAB8C&redir_esc=y\">\"Gamification
  by Design\", by Gabe Zichermann & Christopher Cunningham. </a> Don't worry - I'll
  tie those together in a moment. \n\nThe book starts in the first chapter (as books
  are wont to do), by describing four tiers of Loyalty Rewards that one can use to
  drive engagement in a site or community - Status, Access, Power, and Stuff. \n\n<ul>
  \n<li><em>Status</em> - at least in a community environment - confers a higher status
  on one player than another. This could be through a ranking, through a score, through
  badges, really through any method that you might use to divide users into haves
  and have-nots. This is a powerful engagement driver because it tends to be very
  inexpensive, and players who are <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=karma%20whore\">jockeying
  for status tend to be fiercely loyal to the system</a>. </li> \n<li><em>Access</em>
  - granting information to the player that they would not normally have.  The ability
  to see or even do things ahead of time. </li>\n<li><em>Power</em> - granting rights
  or abilities to the player that they would not normally have - the ability to moderate
  a forum, for example - or even the most basic functionality of a website, in some
  cases. </li>\n<li><em>Stuff</em> - stuff. Objects. Real-life things. Free hats.
  \ Objects are the weakest form of engagement motivator - first of all, people have
  a pretty fine-tuned sense of what 'stuff' is worth. Secondly, people tend to want
  to get their 'stuff' and then get out.  </li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, you often see Status,
  Power, and Access rewards working together in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/privileges\">gamey
  community systems</a>, and Stuff-based rewards... well, whenever there are sales
  to be had. \n\nSuccessful Kickstarter rollouts tend to offer all of these things.
  At the very lowest levels of backing, players get Stuff. The stuff that they want
  to buy. These are the players with the lowest engagement with the product. \n\nAs
  the players kick in more money, though, they get access to more add-ons, sneak-peeks,
  extras, and the like- Power, and Access. \n\nAnd finally, at the highest echelons
  of support, there are players who get Status - and boy do they ever get status.
  The game \"<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2?ref=category\">Wasteland
  2</a>\" is going to be littered with the statues of high-rolling supporters. <em>I
  honestly hope for the opportunity to deface them a little bit. </em>\n\nAnyhoo,
  ramble complete - now look at <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet?ref=spotlight\">these</a>
  Kickstarter <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/JoshuaACNewman/mobile-frame-zero-rapid-attack?ref=category\">projects</a>.
  Sure, I'm unlikely to ever play a LEGO mecha game, but I'm glad that there's someone
  out there making one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
