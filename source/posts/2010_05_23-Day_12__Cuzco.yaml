  - potato pancakes and hard-boiled egg. \n\nOne thing about Peruvian cities, in general,
  is that dogs - domesticated dogs - tend to just wander around free.   \n\nWe drove
  to Cuzco, a few hours. Cuzco is a tourist mecca.  Everybody comes to see Machu Picchu,
  and everybody going to see Machu Picchu - via train, trail, or bus - has to stop
  at Cuzco. \n\nOn the way into Cuzco, we stopped at a Inca ruin - this one a grand
  gate that led into the city. \n\nWe arrived at the hotel around noonish, and it
  was time for showers.  Oh yes, showers.  Nothing like clean clothes and a shave.
  \n\nWe wandered out for lunch, and to explore some of the museums in the town.  Cuzco
  has an impressive Plaza de Armas - not quite the same as Arequipa, but definitely
  impressive. \n\nThe Museo de Historical Something Something was the only museum
  open on Sundays.  The rest closed early, and we missed them.  This museum, however,
  was full of the Same Ol' Same Ol' - arrowheads, pottery, inca artifacts, and Spanish
  art featuring Captain Jesus and his Merry Men.  Our trip has been packed full of
  these things, so nothing that new.  There were only a few things in the museum that
  I had not yet seen - some weaponry (bolas, heavy maces, a sling) and a bit of non-religious
  Spanish art.  Seriously, Spanish art has been <em>so</em> aggressively catholic
  in Peru for the past 400 years that the rare finds are the pieces that <em>aren't</em>
  expousing some sort of divinity. \n\nWe just sat in a park for a bit, looking at
  the fountain and sitting in the shade.\n\nMy headache was coming back, in spades,
  so I stopped at a Botica (Pharmacy) and bought a couple of blister packets of Ibuprofen
  from a big, generic looking container with IBUPROFEN GENERICA written on it in Helvetica.
  \ My Spanish is terrible, but I can usually navigate most transactions given a few
  basic words. (\"Please\", \"Thank you\", \"How much?\", numbers 1-10, 20, 30, 50,
  and 100, and \"Check, please.\" )\n\nLater, we took off for dinner at a nice \"Peruvian
  Fusion\" restaurant.  I had a quesadilla stuffed with sour cream, cheese, chives,
  tomatoes, guacamole, salsa fresca, and alpaca tenderloin meat, with some Chilean
  Sauvignon Blanc and a big glass of water.  Kristen had a bacon cheeseburger. (For
  shame!) \n\nWe returned to the hotel room, and I finally got a crack at the internet!
  Currently describing the trip in painstaking detail - but it's 12:35, so bed soon.
  \n\nTomorrow? A free day in Cuzco (and a little more internet), and then after that,
  our trek starts, and I go offline for some time."
