content: ! "One thing I failed to mention about the dunes - a little story. \n\nKristen
  and I were sleeping along a sand dune, like a little hill almost.  Our bedrolls
  were slippery, as were our sleeping bags, and hard, and so I found that I ever-so-slowly
  slid down throughout the night.  I had to readjust myself a few times during the
  night to keep myself on the bedroll, and I thought, \"this is a pain in the ass,
  I wonder how Kristen is coping.\"\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and poked my head
  out of the sleeping bag, only to see that Kristen and her sleeping bag had merrily
  slid to the bottom of the dune, leaving only her bedroll next to mine as a reminder
  of where she had been. \n\nAnother little thing- if you take a Manfrotto camera
  unipod, stick it deep into the ground next to your sleeping bag, and attach a reading
  light, what you have created is a handy little bedside lamp.  If you take a reading
  light and attach it to your collar, wrapping it around your neck, what you have
  instead is a handy little hands-free neck-lamp.  What a useful little device. "
