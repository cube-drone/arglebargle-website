  shower, and yes, the Britons managed to mangle Chili Con Carne to the point where
  it could only really be described as a bland, tasteless mess.  For one thing, it
  did not technically contain any 'chili' spices - you know, chili powder, mustard
  powder, cumin, anything - merely some green peppers and tomatoes.  For another,
  it was served with spiral pasta.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679706535/\"

  had a quick breakfast of toast and jam, disassembled our tents, and took off on
  the bus.  We drove to Chauchilla Cemetary - in the middle of the desert, a bunch
  of discovered tombs that are from 2000 to 2800 years old.  Our tour guide was a
  local archaeologist, very friendly. He hitched a ride to the site with us on the
  bus, and me and Kristen chatted with him on the way there.  He had a little Canadian
  flag sewn on to his vest - we asked him about it - one of his friends is from Toronto,
  and gave him the flag as a gift.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679739851/\"

  filled with clay-brick-lined holes containing mummified human remains, learning
  about these very ancient people.  They had mastered basic surgery, for one, using
  coca leaf as an analgesic and then thin metal plates to stitch bones together, promoting
  regrowth.  They had also a reasonable-enough understanding of the mummification
  process that many of the corpses that we saw still had hair and flesh.\n\nApparently,
  they are currently in the process of excavating a large step pyramid, built by this
  ancient society, one that was built only one-way, and that way facing the Nazca
  lines.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679791389/\" title=\"Puerto

  hot. We got back into the trucks and drove to Puerto Inka, a little sea-side campsite
  and resort.  We set up our tents for the first time - simple little tents - and
  then I sprung into sandwich duty, cutting up a whole mess of tomatoes and cucumber
  and arranging them neatly on a plate for sandwichization.  At the supermarket, I
  had bought a smallish package of spiced salami for my own personal use, and the
  contraband salami took my lunch sandwiches from 'acceptable' to 'excellent'.\n\n<a

  they will probably kill you. So don't swim in the ocean, yeah?\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4680436920/\"

  and the little resort area nearby had good juice.  Many of our compatriots whiled
  away the rest of the day at the bar, drinking an ever-increasing pile of Cuzquena
  (the local beer) in great big bottles. Kristen and I explored the nearby ruins a
  bit, had some Orange Juice at the bar, and I found a little 'computer shack' with
  power and computers connected to the internet. \n\nI babysat the computers and my
  ebook for a while, trying to get a good charge saved up for the next day - a 'drive'
  day - while at the same time copying a whack of pictures from the camera to the
  computer and checking my email.  I wrote a little bit of this entry, but Kristen
  came to fetch me for dinner and that sort of ate the rest of my night.  This time,
  it was a Pasta Bolognese, one that, despite the chef's best efforts, was almost
  indistinguishable from the Chili Con Carne that had been made the previous night.
  \ No single head of garlic or glopping of tomato sauce can stand up against such
  a vast amount of <em>ground beef</em>.\n\nAfter cleaning up, we found a Foosball
  table, and Lars (young, Hollander, speaks Dutch, English, French, German and a bit
  of Spanish, Master's degree in biomedical research...) creamed all comers, as apparently
  he had spent a few weeks in a hostel practicing constantly.  He beat me 10-2 and
  Dave 10-0.\n\nA book-light, clipped to the inside of a tent, becomes a tent-light.
  \ What a useful device. \n\nThen? Bed. Early rise tomorrow, long drive to Arequipa. "
