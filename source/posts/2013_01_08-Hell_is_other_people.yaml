  <classam> ... 
  <classam> not True and False, you're passing "yes" and "no".
  * classam cries softly
  <vlad|job> Wait... Which language?
  <lumy> classam: checkboxes?
  <classam> Javascript=>Python
  <classam> Checkboxes, yes, but it looks like the reason this code is failing is because the Javascript side is passing "property":"yes" or "no" and the Python side is just setting the flag to true if the "property" exists at all in the POST data
  <classam> "property":"no" ==> yes, the property exists! :D
  <PhilB> OK...to buy a micro-SIM, or cut my own...Hmmm...
  <classam> Cut your own, and then, when you fail, buy one! :P
  <yangman> buy one, then cut it anyway
  * calyth seconds
  * calyth clarifies, he seconds both classam and yangman's suggestion
  <classam> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OemNp6hgX4
  <PhilB> Yeah, I was going to go with classam's model...
  <PhilB> Cut mine, and if I fuck it up, buy one!
  <classam> Also, there's this variable called 'act'
  <classam> what the hell does 'act' do? 
  <classam> It's either 1 or -1
  <classam> is it another flag?
  <classam> If it's set, will the code start EMOTING
